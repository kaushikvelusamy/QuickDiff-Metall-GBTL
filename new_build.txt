This project is designed to use cmake to build and use an "out of source" style build to make it easy to clean up. We build in to a "build" directory by following these steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make

I ususally do: "make -i -j 8" to ignore errors (try to build every test) and to use all my cores.

There is a convenience script to do this from scratch called rebuild.sh that also removes all the old content from a previous use of clean_build.sh.

For CLion support in the cmake project settings "Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake > Generation path:" I set it to ../build.  This sets it to use the same make files as that created by the clean build process so that there aren't two different build trees.

There is also a script called "clean_cmake.sh" that removes all the files, if cmake is run in the src directory or in the root (gbtl) directory.
